Twitter app is inside this folder 
you need to sign up before starting the application
when root path is hit it will redirect to login page where signed up users can login 
once signed up they can see the root page or feed of twetter 
here they have list of tweets by different users
also they have suggestions of whom to follow and followers lists
to see the above functionality please create 5 or 6 users
i havent added uniqness to name and email so it could be more easy to create multiple users
or you can seed files which will create 5 users
